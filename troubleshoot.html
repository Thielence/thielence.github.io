                <h3>Problem 1: Dehumidifier will not start.</h3>
                <p>Solution: Check that the power cord is plugged in properly, and that the outlet is receiving power.
                    Additionally, check that the water tank is correctly positioned and secured, as the machine will not run if it is not in place.

                <h3>Problem 2: Dehumidifier is running, but humidity level is not decreasing.</h3>
                <p>Solution: Ensure that no external sources of humidity, such as open doors or windows, are present. 
                    Once you have confirmed the space is closed, check that the intake fan and air outlet is not blocked. It should also be noted that
                    the dehumidifier is intended to run in temperatures between 41F/5C and 104F/40C, and its efficiency will suffer outside of this range.</p>

                <h3>Problem 3: Water is leaking from the dehumidifier.</h3>
                <p>Solution: If the hose is connected, check that it is properly tightened around the nozzle, and that it is not leaking at any point.
                    If the hose is not connected, ensure that the rubber stopper and drain cap are present on the nozzle.
