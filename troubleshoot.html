                <h3>Problem 1: Dehumidifier will not start.</h3>
                <p>
                    Cause: The dehumidifer will not turn on, it may not be receiving power, or the tank may not be fully secured, which will prevent use as a safety
                    mechanism.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Solution: Check that the power cord is plugged in properly, and that the tank is not loose. If the tank is secure, it should click upon insertion,
                    and not slide out unless the latch at the bottom is held.

                <h3>Problem 2: Dehumidifier is running, but humidity level is not decreasing.</h3>
                <p>
                    Cause: If an external source of humidity such as an open door or window is present, or an active source of moisture such as a boiling pot is in the same room,
                    the incoming moisture will quickly replace what the machine absorbs. The machine may also be outside of its ideal temperature range or have its intake fan
                    or air outlet blocked, in which case its effectiveness will be significantly reduced.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Solution: Check that the space the unit is in is closed off from outdoor conditions, and that nothing within it is actively adding moisture to the environment. 
                    Ensure that the dehumidifer's intake fan and air outlet are open and that the room is between 41F/5C and 104F/40C.

                <h3>Problem 3: Water is leaking from the dehumidifier.</h3>
                <p>
                    Cause: If the hose is connected, it may not be properly secured around the nozzle, in which case water will be able to spill out.
                    Additionally, the hose may have been punctured somewhere, producing a leak. If the hose is not connected, the stopper and drain cap may
                    not be present or properly secured, allowing water to exit through the unsealed nozzle.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Solution: If you are using the hose, ensure it is tightly secured around the nozzle. Should you discover a leak, either replace the hose or find a means
                    of sealing the damaged area, such as waterproof tape or rubber sealant. If the hose is not in use, check that the rubber stopper and drain cap are in place and fully
                    secure.
